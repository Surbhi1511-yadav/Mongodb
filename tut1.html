DIFFERENCE B/W SQL AND NOSQL :

SQL : 
>SQL works on a relational database management system.
>In SQL data is stored in the forms of entity as tables.
>It uses SQL TO query database.

NOSQL(Mongodb)
>NOSQL is a non-relational document oriented database system which works on document based document.
>NOSQL(Mongodb) stores data in form of documents.
>Manogodb uses BSON to query database.

SIMILARTY B/W SQL AND NOSQL :
In both we can create database it's similarity.

DIFFERNCE B/W JSON AND BSON :
JSON :
>TYPE : Standard file format
>SPEED : Less Fast
>SPACE : consumes less space
>USAGE : Transmission of Data

BSON :
>TYPE : Binary file format
>SPEED : Faster
>SPACE : consumes more space
>USAGE : Storage of data.

DOES MONGODB USE BSON OR JSON ?
MongoDB stores data in BSON(JSON like structure) format both internally as well as over the network.

IMPORTANT 
1. SQL data is stored -> TABLE ,NOSQL -> COLLECTION
2. Tables consits of ->ROWS AND COLUMNS
3. Collecrtion consists of Document(Row) and fiels(Columns)
