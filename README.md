# Mongodb

## NoSQL: ##
It is a database used to manage unstructured data, where in the data is not stored in the tabular relations like relational database.

Relational Database failed in solving some of the complex modern problems. Some of them are :
* Continuous change of nature of data.
  * Structured
  * Unstructured
  * Semi-structured
  * Polymorphic data

* Data Intergrity : Applications serve various users at different geo-locations in different time zones and they have to be up and run all the time to maintain the data intergrity.

* Cloud Computing : Applications are beoming distrubted and many moving towards cloud computing.

**Note : --> NoSQL is designed to overcome the problem faced in Relational Database and to also overcome Performance, Scalability, Data Modelling and Distrubtion limitations.**

### Structured Data ###
* Usually text files
* With defined column tiles and Data in rows.
* These Data can be visualized in the form of charts.
* Can be processed using data mining tools.

### Unstructured Data ###
* Unstrutured Data consists of E-mails, Video file, image file, Pdfs etc.
* These Files have nothing in common.
* Structured Information can be extracted from the unstructured data but this can be time consuming.

## NO SQL DATABASE TYPES ###
1. **Document Database:** In this the key is paired with the complex data structure called as document.
Example :  MongoDB

2. **Graph Stores:** In this type of database the networked data is stored. In which we can relate the database with the existing data.

3. **Key-Value Stores:**
