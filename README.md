# Mongodb

## NoSQL: ##
It is a database used to manage unstructured data, where in the data is not stored in the tabular relations like relational database.

Relational Database failed in solving some of the complex modern problems. Some of them are :
* Continuous change of nature of data.
  * Structured
  * Unstructured
  * Semi-structured
  * Polymorphic data

* Data Intergrity : Applications serve various users at different geo-locations in different time zones and they have to be up and run all the time to maintain the data intergrity.

* Cloud Computing : Applications are beoming distrubted and many moving towards cloud computing.

Note : --> NoSQL is designed to overcome the problem faced in Relational Database and to also overcome Performance, Scalability, Data Modelling and Distrubtion limitations.
