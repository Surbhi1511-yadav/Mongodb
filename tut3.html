<!-- Creation of documents, collections  -->
<!-- 1. To check any database is present or not:
    cmd : show dbs
Note : By default three files are present : admin, local, config 
>show dbs
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
local   0.000GB
 -->

<!-- 2. To create a new database we use : 
use databasename 
ex : use Surbhi then in this case Surbhi name database will be created 
switched to db Surbhi -> display 
> use Surbhi
switched to db Surbhi

Note : When we will write command show dbs then it will not show the above database which we have created
to get that database visible we need to add atleast one collection in that.
>show dbs
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
local   0.000GB
-->

<!-- To add a single or insert a single collection 
>db.Surbhi.insertOne({name:"Aditya", age: 24, gender:"Male" , goodMan: true})
{
        "acknowledged" : true,
        "insertedId" : ObjectId("62264434a9f04207e0893eb3")
}

Now when we will write command show Surbhi it will show : 
>show dbs
Surbhi  0.000GB
admin   0.000GB
config  0.000GB
local   0.000GB
-->

<!-- To currently check which database is currently used we use : > db command only 
> db
Surbhi
 -->

 <!-- To currently check the collections present in any database 
>show collections
Surbhi
-->
