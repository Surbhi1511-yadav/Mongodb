<!-- Creation of documents, collections  -->
<!-- 1. To check any database is present or not:
    cmd : show dbs
Note : By default three files are present : admin, local, config  -->

<!-- 2. To create a new database we use : 
use databasename 
ex : use Surbhi then in this case Surbhi name database will be created 
switched to db Surbhi -> display 

Note : When we will write command show dbs then it will not show the above database which we have created
to get that database visible we need to add atleast one collection in that. -->
